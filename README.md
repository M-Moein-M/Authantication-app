# Authentication app

This is a basic authentication app for getting started with [passport-local](http://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-local/) for session based authentication using a [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb#installation-tests) database for saving user's data.

## Files

The **public/css** directory contains the css files for different route just to demonstrate using different styling for different pages(routes) rendering.

The **views** directory is used for compiling templates by **handlebars**

The **passport-config.js** file is used for some configurations in **passport-local** module.

The **sever.js** file is the main code for the server like initializing server, listening to the port, routing, etc.
